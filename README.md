# deliverymanifest
A delivery form for deliveries for ease of use

# Description

As part of a random project to make our delivery process computerized. 

#  Technologies

This delivery form was coded using HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Challenges

Believe you me, one of the hardest parts of this project was trying to figure out where I wanted to link the form once it was completed. I was thinking of using an API and linking it with google docs. But i decided on using a google spreadsheet instead. Another challenge was finding the best way to incorporate a signature pad for the patient to sign for their medication but that is still a work in progress.

Though very simple, use this code as you wish, my dear :)
